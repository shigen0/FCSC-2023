# FCSC-2023
Some write-ups for the France cybersecurity challenge, a highly competitive CTF allowing the winners to be part of the french team for the European Cybersecurity Challenge â€” ECSC. \\
I didn't have too much time for this CTF so I really focused on web, the most interesting write-up is about the sql injection with a original reconnaissance phase !
